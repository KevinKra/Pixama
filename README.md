#PIXAMA

Pixama is application which allows users to browse movies in various categories when logged in as a user or not. Each movie image can be clicked to route to a movie page showing additional information about that movie. A user may also create an account and favorite/unfavorite movies, which will be displayed in a Favorites carousel when they are logged in.

Pixama was built with React and Redux and tested using Jest/Enzyme.
The API used for movie data is [The Movie DB](www.themoviedb.org).
